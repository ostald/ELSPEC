% readFitData - added an input-parameter ppReadingFcn for reading the
% power-profiles. ppReadingFcn should be a function-handle to a function
% that has the same output as readGUISDAPpp, here the function is simply
% passed on to readGUISDAPdata
%
% readFitData - lowered the lower boundary to 60 km.

%
% readGUISDAPdata - changed the output for inclination from Ipp to Ipar.
%
% modelParameters - lowered the lower altitude boundary to 60 km.
%
% modelParameters - modified the re-interpolation to be 
% max(0,sinh(interp(asinh()))) with linear interpolation and extrapolation.
% This should be mathematically robust, whether the ion-composition is 
% sensible is a topic for discussion.
%
% modelParameters - forced the electron and ion temperatures below 80 km to 
% follow the neutral temperatures. This seems at least sensible.
% 
% integrate_continuity_equation - now set electron-densities that are NaN to
% to 1.
%
% update_AICc - inserted a shortcut setting AICc to realmax for the case
% where the electron-spectra becomes infinite. This happened with some 
% cases where the semi-constrained optimization tries values close to a 
% boundary (BG guess...)
%
% update_AICc - also has a hard-coded penalty-term for a positive 
% electron-flux gradient at the high-energy end.
